                    Mavpa (/ukr/ monkey, ape) the Professioanl is a fiction character. It pretends
                    to look professionally, but very often fails all it tries to do.

                    Mavpa the Professional was invented by two brothers in early 2000th. It was inspired
                    by some cartoon series where ape was trained to pilot a space shuttle.
